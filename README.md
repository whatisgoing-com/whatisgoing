# whatisgoing.com

News analytics platform: scrapes news articles, extracts named entities (PERSON/ORG/EVENT), tracks mention frequency and sentiment over time, and surfaces trending topics/persons/orgs and entity "reputation" trends.

## Services

- `cmd/core` — Go modular monolith: source scheduler, RSS/scraper fetcher, pipeline coordinator, internal JSON API.
- `cmd/ui` — Go + htmx BFF, renders the public dashboard from `core`'s JSON API.
- `services/ner-sentiment` — Python (FastAPI): article extraction (`trafilatura`), NER (spaCy), sentence-level sentiment (DistilBERT).

## Local development

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

## Deployment

Images are built and pushed to a self-hosted Harbor registry by Drone CI (path-triggered per service). Drone commits the new image tag to [`whatisgoing-gitops`](https://github.com/whatisgoing-com/whatisgoing-gitops), which ArgoCD syncs to the k3s cluster.

## Tracking

Work is tracked on the [v1 project board](https://github.com/orgs/whatisgoing-com/projects/2).
